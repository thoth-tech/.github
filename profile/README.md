## Products

Open source is at the heart 💜 of Thoth Tech. We maintain and support two popular projects:

- **OnTrack** is an education platform to connect tutors and students at Deakin university as well
  as other universities around the world.
- **SplashKit** is a C++ Software Development Kit. It is a beginner's all-purpose software toolkit
  and can be used to create 2D games.

In addition, we also bootstrap a new project:

- **DreamBig** is a new system that helps students develop their professional identity across their
  courses. It prepares them to smoothly enter the IT professions.

Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to [join our team] 🙌.
